            <h1>This is the beggining of my interactive adventure. Choose wisely each decision decides if you will live or not!</h1>
          <p> You wake up in a walmart and you cant remember anything. You wake up very hungry but you dont know what to do. You hear voices but you cant understand it. You hear a gunshot and you duck for cover. After a couple of minutes passed you get out of cover and you sarted thinking what to do. You are now starving. Your memory came like a flood. You remember this walmart now. You are near the hunting rifles section and the food section is very far from your position.  Decide.</p>
